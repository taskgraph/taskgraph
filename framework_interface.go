// Master-worker paradigm:
// There are usually one master (we can make it fault tolerance) and many workers.
// Master is responsible for making global decision and assign work to individual workers.
// Startup:
// 1. master should start first.
// 2. workers start with a unique worker ID, and ask/notify the master for assignment.
//
// Why master and what should be done on master?
//   Only master can make global decisions. Master should store the states (initial, updated,
// completed, etc.) of each workers and make decisions when state changes. This is important
// when task restart happens and reset state to "initial".
//
// What about worker?
//   Workers do the actual computation and data flow.
//   The framework keeps track of master address(es) in etcd.
